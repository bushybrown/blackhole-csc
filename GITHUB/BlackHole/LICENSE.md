Permission is hereby granted to use the Software for personal, educational, or internal development purposes only, including review of watermarking indicators embedded by the BlackHole Cipher Suite.

## You ARE allowed to:

* Clone or download this repository for private, local inspection.
* Execute and test the cipher using your own messages and keys.
* Study the algorithm structure and internal logic.

## You are NOT allowed to:

* Fork, re-upload, or redistribute the source code publicly.
* Incorporate any part of this code into other software (open-source or commercial).
* Sell, sublicense, or use this code in any commercial product.
* Use this code or `.bhex` output files for machine learning training or dataset aggregation.

## Additional Clauses:

* **Watermark Enforcement**: 
Watermarking & Fingerprinting Clause
BlackHole Cipher Suite includes a proprietary watermarking system embedded at multiple levels of the encryption process:

Rotor Watermarking: Each .bhex file includes a unique ID based on internal rotor state (e.g., WMK-XYZ) used to trace the origin of encrypted output.

Symbolic Tags: AxiomCore inserts unique, non-removable glyphs or symbol arrangements as hidden authorship markers.

Entropy Pattern Signatures: Drift bars and quantum foam signatures are tied to license-specific variants, making tampering or forgery detectable.

Tampering with or removing watermark indicators is strictly prohibited and will constitute a violation of the license agreement. Watermarks do not affect ciphertext readability or decryption integrity, but do serve as cryptographic provenance stamps to track usage across environments.
* **Commercial Licensing**: Contact the creator to discuss paid licensing for integration, modification, or redistribution.
* **AI/ML Prohibition**: Use of any part of this project for model training (including LLMs) is strictly forbidden.

This project is provided "as is" with no warranty, express or implied. Use at your own discretion.
