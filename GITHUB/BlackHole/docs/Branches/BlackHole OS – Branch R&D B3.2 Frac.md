BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B3.2 Fractal Memory Loop
Branch ID: B3.2
Name: Fractal Memory Loop
Origin Universe: Path 3 – Structural Aberrations
Style: Self-Referential Looping, Recursive Entropy Re-Entry
1. Core Philosophy:
Encryption remembers its own logic path, shift values, and entropy—then feeds that memory back into itself.
Each encryption pass mutates based on its prior outputs, creating a feedback loop of increasing complexity.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Initial Encryption Pass:
 - Apply standard logic (e.g., B1.2, B2.1).
 - Record shift values, index positions, and entropy snapshots.
B. Fractal Feedback Trigger:
 - At a defined threshold, loop output data back as modifier seed.
 - Output influences the next encryption stage.
C. Memory-Driven Mutation:
 - Reuse output history for second-pass encryption.
 - Modify character positions or values using fractal logic.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- First pass appears logical.
- Second pass bends the logic using recursive data.
- Glyph behavior varies due to past system memory.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Original encryption path (B1/B2).
- Full shift log and entropy map.
- Feedback injection rules and modifiers.
- Recursive memory logic functions.
5. Security Rating: (6/5)
- Evolving encryption.
- Requires total system state and history to decrypt.
- Resistant to brute-force and synthetic modeling.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Evolves from B1.4 (Recursive Compression Nodes).
- May spiral out of B2.2 (Cantor Drift Displacement).
- Can trigger B4.2 (Glyph Phantom Recall) if memory overflows.
