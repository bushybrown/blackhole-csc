# AxiomCore (Meta-Branch Zero)

 ID: AXC-Z0
 Name: AxiomCore
 Role: Cipher Root Logic (Non-Branching Anchor)
 Design Origin: Axiom of Choice (ZFC Set Theory)

 Core Philosophy

AxiomCore is the fundamental selector at the heart of the BlackHole cipher. Inspired by the Axiom of Choice, it ensures that every encryption path must resolve—even under chaotic or undefined logic.

> “From any set of encryption outcomes, a single result must be chosen.”

This selector enforces symbolic resolution even where logic degrades or diverges. It is the cipher's philosophical spine.

 Functionality

- Applies **after** Fibonacci mutation
- Transforms letters into randomized symbolic pairs (aaaa to zzzz)
- Adds symbolic **noise** to obscure base shift logic
- Ensures each character's transformation is unique and untraceable

---

 Cryptographic Traits

- **Non-deterministic** symbol map
- High entropy via randomized pairing
- Obfuscates original shift values from branch outputs
- Simulates *choice logic* through symbolic diversity

---

 Historical Design (Abandoned Logic)

Originally, AxiomCore was designed to implement a true symbolic simulation of the Axiom of Choice:

- 26 subsets (A-Z)
  - Each containing 20 symbols (12 shared, 8 unique)
- Each letter in the cipher text would be replaced with a symbol from its set
- Subsets mutated across encryption passes

**Issue:** Debugging symbol collision and decryption logic proved infeasible.

---

 Final Implementation

The deployed version simplifies the design:

- Each letter maps to a random 4-letter symbol from AAAA–ZZZZ
- Mapping changes per encryption
- Still achieves:
  - Illusion of symbolic choice
  - Second-layer obfuscation
  - Strong entropy burst after Fibonacci mutation

> _“AxiomCore no longer chooses from sets — it becomes the set.”_

 Integration Points

- **Runs after:** Fibonacci Mutation (B1.2)
- **Feeds into:** Fusion logic and Oracle State
- **Anchors:** Symbol stream before .bhex packaging

---

 Security Summary

- **Resists**: Frequency analysis, linear decryption paths, pattern reconstruction
- **Strengthens**: Layered encryption illusion, entropy density, symbolic camouflage
- **Risks**: Cannot be reversed without correct symbol log; tightly coupled to runtime seed
