BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B3.4 Constructive-Only Layering
Branch ID: B3.4
Name: Constructive-Only Layering
Origin Universe: Path 3 – Structural Aberrations
Style: Immutable Glyph Stacking, Forward-Only Rule Propagation
1. Core Philosophy:
Once a shift is applied, it stays. No corrections. No reversals.
Every encryption round builds on the previous without rollback.
Inspired by blockchain, immutable data structures, and functional programming.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. One-Way Shift Enforcement:
 - Each character receives a shift based on position, key, and prior modifier.
 - Once applied, shifts cannot be reversed.
B. Layer-by-Layer Encryption:
 - Each round adds a new encryption layer on top of the previous.
 - Modifiers may decay, evolve, or compound, but never overwrite.
C. Zero Rewrites / No Overrides:
 - Previous states remain locked.
 - Mistakes or anomalies become part of the cipher structure.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Encryption accumulates like sediment.
- No partial decryption possible without full stack.
- Glyphs may appear fossilized or deeply transformed.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Complete layer history in order.
- Modifier functions for each layer.
- All entropy patterns and distortion effects across rounds.
5. Security Rating: (7/5)
- Fully prevents backtracking.
- Accidental complexity becomes embedded strength.
- No possible short-circuit decrypt paths.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Final layer option for any B1–B3 branch.
- Nullifies B2.4 retroactive overrides.
- May collide with B3.3 if logic proof can't be layered.
- Can invoke B4.1 (Phantom Echo Chain) under heavy entropy.
