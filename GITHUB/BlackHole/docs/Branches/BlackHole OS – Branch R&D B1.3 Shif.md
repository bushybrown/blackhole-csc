BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B1.3 Shift Decay Cascade
Branch ID: B1.3
Name: Shift Decay Cascade
Origin Universe: Path 1 – BlackHole Prime
Style: Gradual Dissolution, Temporal Shift Regression
1. Core Philosophy:
Shift Decay Cascade models a cipher that decays over time, like a signal losing strength.
Early characters are encrypted with high energy, but the logic slowly deteriorates.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Initial Shift Calculation:
 - First character has the highest shift value (based on key, vowel cube, or Fibonacci).
B. Apply Decay Curve:
 - Each next character’s shift = previous shift - decay_rate.
 - decay_rate may depend on message length, chaos factor, or key modifier.
 - Optionally use logarithmic or exponential decay.
C. Entropy Breakpoints:
 - At fixed intervals (e.g., every 5th or 13th char), decay may reset or invert slightly.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Start: intense shifts and encryption power.
- Middle: predictable decline in mutation.
- End: low-shift or near-plaintext behavior.
- Creates 'fading signal' illusion.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Starting shift value and decay_rate formula.
- Breakpoint positions and inversion logic.
- All relevant modifier inputs.
5. Security Rating: (4/5)
- Defeats brute force via non-uniformity.
- Obfuscates frequency analysis.
- Can be reverse-engineered if decay logic is known.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- May follow B1.2 (Fibonacci Mutation).
- May evolve into B2.2 (Cantor Drift Displacement).
- May reset to B1.1 (Cubed Vowel Logic) if decay hits zero.
