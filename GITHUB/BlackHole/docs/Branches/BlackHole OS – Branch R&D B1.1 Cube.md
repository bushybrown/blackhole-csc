BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B1.1 Cubed Vowel Logic
Branch ID: B1.1
Name: Cubed Vowel Logic
Origin Universe: Path 1 – BlackHole Prime
Style: Foundational, Deterministic Chaos
1. Core Philosophy:
Cubed Vowel Logic treats vowels as emotional and structural anchors. The first vowel in a message
is extracted and used to generate a cube-based modifier (y), which alters the shift value for each character.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Identify First Vowel:
 - Scan message left to right for A, E, I, O, or U (any case).
 - This becomes the trigger vowel.
B. Assign Cube Modifier:
 A = 6^3 = 216
 E = 7^3 = 343
 I = 8^3 = 512
 O = 9^3 = 729
 U = 11^3 = 1331
C. Modify Characters:
 - For each character, use: (y + index + shift_mod)^3
 - Then: ((cube_value / 2) + 10) / 3 + cube_mod → shift value
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Short messages still transform drastically.
- Long messages grow more chaotic over time.
- Messages without vowels can use default or consonant-derived base.
Optional Chaos Rules:
- Repeated vowels double influence.
- Vowel in last word increases cube base by +1.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Trigger vowel and exact cube value (y)
- All key-based modifiers
- Precise knowledge of branch logic
→ Without these, results in random or false decryptions.
5. Security Rating: (4.5/5)
- Cube logic creates massive, hard-to-reverse shifts.
- Appears as entropy to outsiders.
- False-positive outputs possible.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Evolves to B1.2 (Fibonacci Mutation) if vowel count exceeds threshold.
- May mutate into B2.1 (Mid-Infinite Splinter) based on vowel:length ratio.
