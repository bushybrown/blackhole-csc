BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B1.4 Recursive Compression Nodes
Branch ID: B1.4
Name: Recursive Compression Nodes
Origin Universe: Path 1 – BlackHole Prime
Style: Nested Complexity, Compressed Self-Reference
1. Core Philosophy:
This branch applies layered encryption recursively, using the output of one pass to define the logic of the next.
Each compression layer mutates based on the structure of the previous one, forming a self-encrypting logic loop.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Base Encryption Layer:
 - Begin with standard BlackHole logic (e.g., B1.1 or B1.2).
 - This is considered Layer 0.
B. Compression Iteration:
 - Encrypt the result again with adjusted shift logic.
 - New logic is based on the structure of the previous layer.
 - Key fragments mutate per layer.
C. Stop Condition:
 - Stop after fixed iterations (e.g., 3–5), or
 - If entropy reaches target threshold, or
 - If message length stabilizes.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Output becomes dense and difficult to parse.
- No repeating patterns.
- Decryption requires exact reverse traversal of each layer.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Knowledge of every layer’s key logic and order.
- Exact number of layers and structure per pass.
- Mutation rules and branch path history.
- A single mistake causes decryption to fail entirely.
5. Security Rating: (5.5/5)
- Recursively increasing complexity.
- Resembles compressed noise.
- Brutally hard to brute-force.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Consumes B1.1 through B1.3 as recursive fuel.
- May loop into B3.1 (Manual Key Dependency) if recursion overflows.
- May crash into B4.1 as entropy failsafe.
