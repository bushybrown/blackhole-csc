BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B3.1 Manual Key Dependency
Branch ID: B3.1
Name: Manual Key Dependency
Origin Universe: Path 3 – Structural Aberrations
Style: Direct Key Injection, Structural Override Logic
1. Core Philosophy:
This branch converts the encryption key into the encryption system itself.
The key defines the logic paths, shifts, modifiers, and structure of the cipher engine.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Direct Key Parsing:
 - Key is analyzed for length, symbols, vowels, and numeric content.
 - These elements dictate the logic paths and structure.
B. Key-Defined Branching:
 - Vowel-rich keys use vowel-based shifts.
 - Numeric-heavy keys trigger Fibonacci or recursive logic.
 - Symbolic keys inject phantom or compression paths.
C. One-Time Path Registration:
 - Path is dynamically created from key.
 - Cannot be reproduced without exact key.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Output varies wildly with minor key changes.
- Creates entirely custom encryption engines per user.
- Extremely hard to pattern-match or reverse-engineer.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Exact key is required (no partial recovery).
- Logic must be reconstructed using the same parsing rules.
- All modifiers are derived from the key's internal structure.
5. Security Rating: (6/5)
- Brute force highly ineffective.
- Structural logic is non-reproducible without correct key.
- Keys shape the cipher, not just unlock it.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Can override B1.1–B2.3 during startup.
- May destabilize B1.4 or B2.3 under high entropy.
- May trigger B3.3 (Error Bending) if logic overflow occurs.
