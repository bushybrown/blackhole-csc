BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B4.4 Rule Inversion by Vowel Count
Branch ID: B4.4
Name: Rule Inversion by Vowel Count
Origin Universe: Path 4 – Phantom Constructs
Style: Conditional Logic Reversal, Vowel-Triggered Flip Mode
1. Core Philosophy:
Encryption rules invert when vowel thresholds are breached.
Too many vowels cause the logic to flip, reversing all transformations.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Vowel Count Initialization:
 - Count vowels in the message, key, or first segment.
 - Compare to a hidden threshold (e.g., Fibonacci value, entropy %).
B. Flip Trigger:
 - If vowel count exceeds threshold:
 • Shift logic reverses
 • Fibonacci indexes invert
 • Layering deconstructs
 • Symbol flips occur
C. Path Override Activation:
 - Switches from normal to inverted logic mid-process.
 - All branch behavior reverses direction.
 - Decryption assumes flip if flagged.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Small changes in vowel usage cause major shifts.
- Two similar messages may encrypt radically differently.
- Partial flip can cause hybrid logic and recursive echo.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Vowel count at encryption time.
- Threshold and logic inversion rules.
- Inversion trigger location in message.
- Original (pre-flip) logic path.
5. Security Rating: (7/5)
- Adds unpredictable linguistic condition.
- Prevents brute-force and pattern analysis.
- Behavior can reverse mid-message, confusing all logic trees.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Inverts any B1–B3 logic path.
- May recursively loop B4.2 via vowel decay drift.
- Dismantles B3.4 layering if triggered late.
- Scrambles Cantor Drift calculations in B2.3.
