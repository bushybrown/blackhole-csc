BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B2.1 Mid-Infinite Splinter
Branch ID: B2.1
Name: Mid-Infinite Splinter
Origin Universe: Path 2 – CH-False Logic
Style: Infinite Set Fracturing, Controlled Chaos
1. Core Philosophy:
Inspired by the Continuum Hypothesis, this branch fractures logic midway through encryption.
The system intentionally abandons consistent rules and relies on phantom logic to complete the message.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Begin Normal Encryption:
 - Start with structured logic (e.g., Fibonacci or Cubed Vowel).
B. Midpoint Fracture:
 - At a chosen or random point, the logic splits.
 - Replaced by corrupted or placeholder logic (phantom branch).
C. Shadow Logic Resolution:
 - Second half uses undefined rules.
 - Decryption must apply hidden logic tree to resolve correctly.
 - Multiple false decryptions may appear plausible.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- First half: logical and structured.
- Second half: chaotic, phantom-based.
- Without proper key path, false positives are likely.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Splinter point index.
- Original encryption logic for first half.
- Correct phantom logic tree ID.
- External context often needed to resolve ambiguity.
5. Security Rating: (5/5)
- Mid-message logic fracture defies brute force.
- Creates false positives (plausible decrypts).
- Mirrors Godelian incompleteness.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Evolves from B1.4 (Recursive Compression Nodes) after failed recursion.
- May transition into B2.3 (Entangled Sequence Shift).
- Can backtrack to B1.2 (Fibonacci Mutation) if reintegration is needed.
