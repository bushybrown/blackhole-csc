BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B4.2 Glyph Phantom Recall
Branch ID: B4.2
Name: Glyph Phantom Recall
Origin Universe: Path 4 – Phantom Constructs
Style: Forgotten Glyph Reconstruction, Recursive Memory Injection
1. Core Philosophy:
Encryption intentionally forgets parts of the message.
Reconstruction occurs only through simulated memory at decrypt-time.
No stored values exist for certain glyphs—only the logic that pretends to remember.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Intentional Nulling:
 - Blanks specific glyphs after encryption (e.g., every 4th letter).
 - No record kept of these values—only positions.
B. Phantom Memory Injection:
 - Reconstructs lost glyphs via logic patterns and entropy drift.
 - Uses probabilistic modeling, context scanning, and drift alignment.
C. Echo Refinement Loop:
 - Continuously compares reconstructed values.
 - Stabilizes output through chaotic or convergent feedback until threshold is met.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Multiple decrypts yield slightly different results.
- Some decrypted values were never stored—only inferred.
- May trick analysts into believing incorrect decryptions are correct.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Null glyph position map.
- Logic and entropy reconstruction patterns.
- Threshold for stabilization of phantom recall.
5. Security Rating: (7/5)
- Prevents perfect recovery of message.
- Makes brute force produce inconsistent false positives.
- Undermines pattern recognition tools.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Pairs well with B3.2 and B1.4 for recursive memory corruption.
- Can cause unstable loops in B4.1 echoes.
- May trigger infinite drift if unbounded.
