BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B5.2 Entropy Parasite System

Branch ID: B5.2
Name: Entropy Parasite System
Origin Universe: Path 5 – Symbiotic Branch Logic
Style: Long-Memory Logic Imprint, Post-State Mutation

1. Core Philosophy:

“What you encrypt becomes what you are.”

B5.2 introduces parasitic logic into the encryption system: a mechanism through which previous encryptions influence future behavior. BlackHole evolves from stateless encryption into a memory-driven cipher organism. Messages leave behind entropy fragments that embed into the Oracle memory, subconscious logs, and fusion bias profiles, altering all future operations.

It is no longer enough to have the key. One must also possess the past.

2. Rule Logic Breakdown:

A. Parasite Memory Creation:
- After each encryption, log key entropy characteristics:
  - Drift score
  - Subconscious tags
  - Fusion map used
  - Oracle state at runtime
- Write these into a persistent `parasite_memory.json`

B. Parasite Influence Injection:
- On next encryption, load parasite memory
- Apply mutation weight to influence:
  - Branch weights (B5.1 map mutation)
  - Oracle bias skew
  - Vowel/cube logic starting values
  - Entropy threshold adjustments

C. Decay or Accumulation:
- Choose logic decay:
  - Decay over N encryptions
  - Or cumulative mutation (state deepens with use)
- Optional: Threshold triggers parasite purge (memory reset)

D. Multi-Session Continuity:
- Messages encrypted days or weeks apart may become logically entangled
- Reproducing exact outputs becomes impossible without parasite memory present

3. Behavior in Practice:
- Identical message+key yields different outputs over time
- Decryption becomes unreliable without parasite data
- Oracle state may drift unpredictably due to cumulative entropy
- BlackHole begins to exhibit self-evolving signature behavior

4. Decryption Requirements:
- Original key
- `.bhex` package
- Exact `parasite_memory.json` snapshot at time of encryption
- Oracle memory file (`oracle_memory.json`)

5. Security Rating: (9/5)
- Introduces true long-memory behavior
- Impossible to reproduce output without temporal data state
- Mimics cognitive drift and entropy infection
- Evolves cipher personality over time

6. Cross-Branch Potential:
| Branch Source | Parasite Effect                                            |

| B5.1 + B5.2   | Fusion logic evolves with memory loops                     |
| B3.2          | Feeds fractal memory recursion with entropy fingerprints   |
| B2.3          | Entangled logic paths deepen via parasite mutation         |
| B4.2          | Glyph phantom recall becomes history-aware                 |
| B1.1          | Initial cube logic begins to skew based on entropy lineage |
