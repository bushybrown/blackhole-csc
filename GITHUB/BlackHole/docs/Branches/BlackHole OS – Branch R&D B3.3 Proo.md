BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B3.3 Proof Constrained Mapping
Branch ID: B3.3
Name: Proof Constrained Mapping (a.k.a. Error Bending)
Origin Universe: Path 3 – Structural Aberrations
Style: Exception-Driven Encoding, Fault-Tolerant Logic Conversion
1. Core Philosophy:
Logic doesn't always work—so this system bends when it breaks.
Each encryption rule must be provable within its own logic. If proof fails, the system redirects rather than crashing.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Logic Assertion Initialization:
 - Rules include a logic ID and constraint check.
 - If valid, proceed. If invalid, trigger error redirect.
B. Error Bending Path Selection:
 - Contradictions launch alternative logic paths.
 - Redirection may use micro-paths or hybrid branches.
C. Recursive Constraint Echo:
 - Failed logic is recorded.
 - Broken rules mutate later segments as custom glyph shifts.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Appears chaotic without constraint map.
- May produce decryptions that seem valid but aren't.
- Works best when designed to simulate 'intentional imperfection.'
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Initial logic path.
- Constraint and logic failure logs.
- Error resolution handlers and redirect rules.
- Full proof constraint map.
5. Security Rating: (7/5)
- Immune to brute force due to logic traps.
- Creates plausible yet incorrect outputs.
- Rewires logic on-the-fly based on rule failures.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- May evolve from B2.4 or B3.2 logic overloads.
- Can hijack B1.3 if decay causes collapse.
- May create phantom branches if not fully constrained.
