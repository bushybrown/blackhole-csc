BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B2.3 Entangled Sequence Shift
Branch ID: B2.3
Name: Entangled Sequence Shift
Origin Universe: Path 2 – CH-False Logic
Style: Quantum-Mimetic Logic, Mutual Dependence Encoding
1. Core Philosophy:
Encryption is applied relationally. Characters are entangled such that the encryption of one affects the other.
Decrypting one character requires knowledge of its entangled partner and the full logical structure.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Sequence Pairing:
 - Characters are paired based on: vowel/consonant type, prime indices, or reflection mapping.
B. Entangled Shift Calculation:
 - Each pair gets a shared modifier:
 shift_A = f(index_A, index_B, key_mod)
 shift_B = f(index_B, index_A, key_mod)
C. Simultaneous Mutation:
 - Both characters shift together.
 - Ripple effects apply if logic paths diverge.
Optional: If pairs span logic boundaries, cross-branch instability may trigger.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Characters can't be decrypted in isolation.
- Full message must be interpreted as a single system.
- Disruption in one pair affects the others.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Full entangled pair map.
- Modifier functions and inputs.
- All logic paths involved.
- Message length and structure.
5. Security Rating: (5.5/5)
- Defeats isolated or brute force decryption.
- False positive decrypts are common if pairing is wrong.
- Immune to linear decryption attacks.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Evolves from B2.2 (Cantor Drift Displacement) when drift overlaps logic paths.
- May collapse into B3.3 (Error Bending) under recursive logic clash.
- May recursively pair under B1.4 (Recursive Compression Nodes).
