BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B1.2 Fibonacci Mutation
Branch ID: B1.2
Name: Fibonacci Mutation
Origin Universe: Path 1 – BlackHole Prime
Style: Chaotic Predictability, Sequential Drift
1. Core Philosophy:
Messages evolve like organisms, mutating based on Fibonacci sequences. Early characters follow one path; later
characters mutate using increasing intervals, mimicking growth in nature. Encryption becomes increasingly unhingedyet mathematically beautiful.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Generate Fibonacci Sequence:
 - Generate a long Fibonacci sequence (e.g., 100,000 values).
 - Starting point is determined by: trigger vowel, key modifiers, and message length.
 - Index: start_index = vowel_seed + fib_mod
B. Assign Shift Values:
 - Each character's shift uses Fibonacci numbers starting from the index:
 char[0] = fib[start_index]
 char[1] = fib[start_index + 1]
 ...
 - Loop sequence if needed.
C. Apply Shift:
 - Use Fibonacci value directly or mod (e.g., %26).
 - Optional: alternate directions (even index = forward, odd = reverse).
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Early message shows clear pattern.
- Middle and end of message increase in entropy.
- Certain Fibonacci values align with common letters, creating random-like jumps.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Exact starting Fibonacci index.
- Key modifiers and vowel seed.
- Modifier rules (reversals, mod operations).
- Original message length (if Fibonacci loops dynamically).
5. Security Rating: (5/5)
- Based on a non-repeating numerical sequence.
- Small changes to input drastically change the output.
- Impossible to reverse without precise values and logic tree.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- May evolve from B1.1 when vowel count exceeds threshold.
- Can transition into B3.2 (Static Structure Override) during high entropy states.
- May briefly touch B4.4 (Rule Inversion by Vowel Count) in chaos mode.
