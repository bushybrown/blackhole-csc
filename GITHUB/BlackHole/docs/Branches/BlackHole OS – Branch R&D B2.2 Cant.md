BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B2.2 Cantor Drift Displacement
Branch ID: B2.2
Name: Cantor Drift Displacement
Origin Universe: Path 2 – CH-False Logic
Style: Infinite Set Mutation, Drift-Driven Divergence
1. Core Philosophy:
Inspired by Cantor's set theory, this branch introduces drift: encryption begins with one logic and shifts into another.
The transformation can be smooth or abrupt, driven by entropy thresholds or segment limits.
2. Rule Logic Breakdown:
A. Initialize with Ordered Logic:
 - Begin with standard logic (e.g., Cubed Vowel or Fibonacci).
 - Define alternate logic options (e.g., [B1.1, B2.1, B3.3]).
B. Set a Drift Rate:
 - Introduce entropy thresholds or drift intervals (e.g., every 13 characters).
 - When threshold is reached, logic changes.
C. Cascade Through Logic Sets:
 - Each segment is encrypted using a different logic method.
 - Transitions may be smooth or sudden.
Bonus: Logic Looping:
 - Long messages may loop back to previous logic sets in mutated form.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Early message is predictable and structured.
- Middle message becomes inconsistent.
- Later message may contradict or mutate previous logic.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Original logic set.
- Drift threshold and transition map.
- Modifier keys that define shift behavior and logic loopback.
5. Security Rating: (5/5)
- Defeats global decryption models.
- Increases unpredictability without loss of structure.
- Multiple logic paths create non-invertible patterns without key knowledge.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Evolves from B2.1 (Mid-Infinite Splinter) under entropy stress.
- May invoke B3.3 (Error Bending) during transitions.
- Can loop into B1.3 (Shift Decay Cascade) as fallback path.
