#  BlackHole OS – Branch Documentation

Welcome to the **BlackHole OS** branch library — the internal R&D schematics for every modular logic mutation used throughout the BlackHole encryption system.

Each file below documents a specific branch: its origin, behavior, recursive potential, and security implications. Together, they map the inner terrain of BlackHole’s drift logic and fusion dynamics.

 Branch Index

 ** B1 Series – Foundational Logic**
- **B1.1 Cubed Vowel Logic**  
  Probabilistic vowel cube shifts based on modular indexing.

  Recursive key shaping based on Fibonacci sequences.
- **B1.3 Shift Decay Cascade**  
  Controlled entropy dropouts with shift overflows.
- **B1.4 Recursive Compression Nodes**  
  Multi-layer self-encrypting logic loops using prior layers.

 ** B2 Series – Entropic Displacement**
- **B2.1 Mid-Infinite Splinter**  
  Divergent drift splits around midpoint heuristics.

  Encryption logic must satisfy symbolic 'truth'.
- **B3.4 Constructive-Only Layering**  
  Logic must build up but can never self-destruct.

 ** B4 Series – Phantom Behaviors**
- **B4.1 Phantom Echo Chain**  
  Invisible state echoes create delayed logic propagation.
- **B4.2 Glyph Phantom Recall**  
  Symbol states regress when triggered by entropy tags.
- **B4.3 Null Signature Collapse**  
  Zero-state folding produces data without signature.
- **B4.4 Rule Inversion by Vowel Count**  
  Vowel count alone triggers inversion of branch logic.

 ** B5 Series – Entropy Parasitics**
- **B5.1 Entropic Fusion Node**  
  Entropy-tuned hybridization of active branches.
- **B5.2 Entropy Parasite System** 
  Residual entropy siphoned from abandoned branches.

###  Notes

- All branches may be invoked via `fusion_branches/`.
- Some branches have dormant fallback conditions only triggered under specific Oracle states or entropy thresholds.
- Some branches have been modified or excluded from BlackHole V6.
- Each branch represents a starting point but does not reflect overall structure. 
- Each branch can be modified to suite personal skill, thought or desire.  
- Each branch represents a possible final outcome where the final outcome path is designed to be unknowable. 
- Licensing restricts unauthorized forking or derivative logic use without permission. See `LICENSE.md`.
