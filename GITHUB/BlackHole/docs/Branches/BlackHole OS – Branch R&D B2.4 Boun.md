BlackHole OS – Branch R&D: B2.4 Boundary Blur Logic
Branch ID: B2.4
Name: Boundary Blur Logic (a.k.a. The Phantom Operator)
Origin Universe: Path 2 – CH-False Logic
Style: Retroactive Logic Echo, Hidden Operator Binding
1. Core Philosophy:
B2.4 is a stabilizing ghost operation that exists between logic paths.
It allows contradictory logic systems to coexist temporarily by applying retroactive and hidden transformations.
2. Key Concepts:
• Soft Transitions:
 - Prevents abrupt crashes between paths using ghost modifiers.
• Null Glyph Entanglement:
 - Uses empty or placeholder glyphs to bridge incompatible logic states.
• Echoed Drift Logic:
 - Retroactively applies false logic justification to earlier cipher segments.
• Blur Threshold Events:
 - Phantom logic activates based on message length, entropy, or character pattern.
3. Behavior in Practice:
- Appears as a normal cipher until the phantom operator is triggered.
- Without the boundary blur logic, earlier parts of the message may appear decrypted but are incorrect.
- Creates believable false decryptions.
4. Decryption Requirements:
- Phantom trigger (key fragment, entropy flag, or length signal).
- Knowledge of where and when blur activation occurs.
- Retroactive logic map to reprocess earlier segments.
5. Security Rating: (5.5/5)
- Defeats pattern-matching logic.
- Retroactively redefines message segments.
- Creates multi-path decrypt illusions.
6. Cross-Branch Potential:
- Stabilizes transitions between B2.1–B2.3.
- May appear silently in B1.4 (Recursive Compression) or B3.3 (Error Bending).
- Can reinforce phantom triggers introduced by user-defined logic paths.
