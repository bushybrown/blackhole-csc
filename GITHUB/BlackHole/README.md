#  BlackHole V6  
### Conscious-State Cryptography for the Post-Classical Age

> _“The boundary of thought is the first encryption.”_

BlackHole is not your standard cipher. It is a recursive, drift-based encryption engine inspired by entropy physics, symbolic mutation, and the idea that encryption can evolve like consciousness. It doesn’t just hide messages—it obfuscates their **very existence**.

Born on a night shift and fueled by philosophical obsession, **BlackHole** has grown into a **self-mutating encryption system** that resists not just brute force but recognition itself.

##  What Is BlackHole?

BlackHole is a Python-based recursive encryption system that:

- Shifts logic based on **symbolic drift** and **AxiomCore mappings**
- Mutates entropy through **Fibonacci**, **quantum foam**, and **phantom rotors**
- Produces outputs with **chaotic structure**, indistinguishable from signal noise
- Encrypts into `.bhex` packages—tamper-resistant, introspective, and untraceable
- Features **Fractal Drift**, **Parasite Memory**, **Fusion Logic**, and **Oracle Bias**

This isn’t AES. This is **Conscious-State Cryptography (CSC)**—a system that evolves based on itself and its environment.

##  Getting Started

###  Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

##  Core Philosophy

BlackHole wasn’t designed to follow standards—it was designed to disappear. It operates on the premise that true security isn’t about hiding data, but hiding the fact that **there is data**. It is symbolic encryption, recursive entropy, and riddle-engineering combined into one elegant, drifting enigma.
